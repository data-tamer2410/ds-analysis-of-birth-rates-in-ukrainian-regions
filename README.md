# Analysis of Birth Rates in Ukrainian Regions
Analysis of birth rates in ukrainian regions.

## Description
This project explores fertility rate trends in Ukraine from 1950 to 2019 across different regions. Using data extracted from Wikipedia, we analyze how the birth rates have changed over time and provide visual insights into the factors influencing these trends. A special focus is given to the significant dip in birth rates in the Luhansk region in 2014, which is likely associated with the Russian invasion.
